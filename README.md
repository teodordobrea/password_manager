# Password Manager

## A python GUI app that helps you keep track of the passwords that you use.

This app was build using the Python module Tkinter. In this app users can:
* Save the details that they've used to log into a specific website.
* Generate random passwords for that specific website. The generated password is already saved to the user's clipboard once they have clicked the "Generate" button.
* Search for a specific website to retrieve the email and password for that website.

The app saves all the data into a data.json file.
